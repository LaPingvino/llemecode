I’m not able to call a tool named `ask_gemma2:2b` because that tool isn’t defined in the current toolset. The available “ask_*” helpers are:

- `ask_gpt-oss:latest`
- `ask_phi:2.7b`
- `ask_deepseek-r1:1.5b`
- `ask_command-r:latest`
- `ask_deepseek-coder:1.3b`
- `ask_yi-coder:1.5b`
- `ask_qwen2.5-coder:1.5b`
- `ask_functiongemma:270m`
- and a few others.

If you’d like me to ask one of those models a “How are you?” question, just let me know which one, and I’ll invoke it for you. Alternatively, if you have access to a `gemma2:2b` model elsewhere, you can run it yourself.
